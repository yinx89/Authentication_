# Authentication_

Authentication MVC project using OpenID Connect against an Identity Provider, OWIN middleware, an Azure tenant and all encoded in JWT tokens through OAuth2.

Once the authentication has been carried out correctly, the reading of the values of the JWT tokens is checked and it is determined if the user has the appropriate permissions to visualize the corresponding variables. A report is then developed showing the number of patients found in each BMI category and displays the percentile that the current userâ€™s BMI falls within.
